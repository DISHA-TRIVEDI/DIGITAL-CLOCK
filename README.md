# Digital-Clock
## Purpose
The purpose of a digital clock is to provide a convenient and easy-to-read display of the current time. They usually have a clear and legible display, making it easier to read the time accurately. They also often include additional features such as alarm functions, date displays, and sometimes even temperature readings. Serving as a practical tool for time management and synchronization in various settings.
## Languages Used
### HTML
It serves as the foundation for structuring the content and providing a container for the clock display. To create a digital clock, HTML is responsible for defining the layout and structure of the clock on the webpage. It involve creating a container element, typically a div tag, which will hold the clock display.
### CSS  
It is essential for styling and enhancing the appearance of a digital clock created using HTML and JavaScript. CSS allows you to control the visual aspects of the clock, such as font size, color, alignment, and positioning. It plays a significant role in ensuring that the clock is visually appealing and seamlessly integrated into the overall design of the webpage.  

With CSS, you can target the clock container element created in HTML using its ID or class and apply various style properties to it.
### JS
is instrumental in creating a digital clock by providing the dynamic functionality required to update and display the current time. JS allows for the manipulation of HTML elements, making it possible to modify the content of the clock container in real-time.

When building a digital clock, JavaScript utilizes the Date object, a built-in JavaScript object that represents the current date and time. By accessing the properties of the Date object, such as getHours(), getMinutes(), and getSeconds(), JS retrieves the current time values.

This is achieved by accessing the clock container element using its ID or class and modifying its innerHTML property to reflect the updated time. By doing so, JS ensures that the displayed time is continuously updated and accurately reflects the current time.
